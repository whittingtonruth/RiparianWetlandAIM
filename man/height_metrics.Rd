\title{Calculate average herbaceous and woody height and litter and water depth.}
\usage{
height_metrics(
  height_tall,
  masterspecieslist,
  method = "mean",
  by_line = FALSE,
  omit_zero = TRUE,
  by_species = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{height_tall}{Data frame. Use the data frame from the \code{gather_height_lentic()} output.}

\item{masterspecieslist}{Data frame. The centrally managed master species list should be used.}

\item{method}{Character string.  Indicates the type of summary to calculate, \code{"max"}, which yields the average maximum height on the plot or \code{"mean"} which yields the mean height.}

\item{by_line}{Logical. If TRUE then results will be reported further grouped by line using 'LineKey. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{omit_zero}{Logical. Indicates whether zeros should be included in average height and depth calculations. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{by_species}{Logical. If TRUE, then results will  reported by species-plot rather than at the plot or transect level. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
Data frame of the summarized height data by plot grouped into herbaceous, litter, water, or woody categories.

\description{
Calculate average herbaceous and woody height and litter and water depth.
